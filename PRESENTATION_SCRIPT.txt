                    Comprehensive Urban Health Analysis Platform
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[SLIDE 1: TITLE]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hello everyone, I'm excited to present UrbanScope - an AI-powered platform that 
transforms NASA satellite data into actionable insights for urban health planning.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING:

1. URBAN HEAT CRISIS
   - Cities are 5-7°C hotter than surrounding areas (Urban Heat Island effect)
   - Heat-related deaths increasing by 30% in past decade
   - Vulnerable populations most affected: elderly, low-income communities
   - City planners lack real-time data to identify heat risk zones

2. GREEN SPACE INEQUALITY
   - Only 40% of urban residents have access to green spaces within 300m
   - WHO recommends 9m² green space per person - most cities fall short
   - Unequal distribution: wealthy neighborhoods have 3x more green space
   - No standardized way to measure and track green space accessibility

3. HEALTHCARE ACCESS GAPS
   - 30% of urban populations lack 15-minute access to healthcare facilities
   - Emergency response times exceed safe limits in underserved areas
   - City growth outpaces healthcare infrastructure development
   - No data-driven tools to identify where new facilities are needed

4. FRAGMENTED DATA
   - NASA collects petabytes of Earth observation data
   - Data is complex, technical, and inaccessible to urban planners
   - No integrated platform combining heat, green space, and healthcare data
   - Decision-makers can't see the full picture of urban health

THE IMPACT:
→ Preventable deaths from heat stress
→ Increased chronic diseases from lack of green spaces
→ Healthcare system overload in underserved areas
→ Billions wasted on ineffective urban planning

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   enterprise licensing for large-scale deployments.

Q: How often is data updated?
A: Temperature data: Daily
   NDVI/vegetation: Every 16 days
   Healthcare facilities: Based on OpenStreetMap updates

Q: Can we export the data?
A: Yes, all analysis results can be exported as JSON. We're adding PDF report 
   generation in the next release.

Q: What about data privacy?
A: We use only publicly available satellite data and aggregate statistics. 
   No personal or sensitive information is collected.

Q: How do you validate recommendations?
A: Recommendations are based on WHO standards, peer-reviewed research, and 
   validated urban planning best practices.
