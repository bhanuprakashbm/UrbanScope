# urban_heat_notifier

## Overview

This project is based on the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter 200.6 and ArcGIS Location Platform. Users will be notified when they are in a heat-risk area. They can display POIs with options for cooling down/drinking or where they can get help and can navigate there with a compass.

## Getting Started

To build this app, you will require the following:

https://developers.arcgis.com/flutter/get-started/


Step 1: Get the SDK and dependencies

Navigate to the `urban_heat_notifier` directory.

Run: dart pub add arcgis_maps
Run: flutter pub upgrade
Run: dart run arcgis_maps install


Step 2: Configure environment variables (based on [ENVied](https://pub.dev/packages/envied))

Edit the .env configuration file

    - insert your API Key --> APIKEY=......
    -
    -

Use `dart run build_runner build` to run the generator:

```
dart run build_runner build
```

When modifying the .env file, the generator might not pick up the change. If that happens simply clean the build cache and run the generator again.

```
dart run build_runner clean
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Step 3 Run the application

```
flutter run
```
