PAGE 2: HEAT RISK ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPONENT 1: CITY SEARCH BAR
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
A search box where you can type any city name worldwide.

PURPOSE:
Allows users to analyze heat risk for any city on Earth.

HOW IT WORKS:
As you type, it suggests matching cities. Select one and it stores the city's coordinates for analysis.

EXAMPLE:
Type "Del" → Shows "Delhi, India" → Click to select → Coordinates (28.7°N, 77.1°E) saved


COMPONENT 2: DATE SELECTOR
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
A calendar input showing today's date by default.

PURPOSE:
Lets you analyze heat risk for any past date to see historical patterns.

HOW IT WORKS:
Click to open calendar, select a date (can't pick future dates), and analysis uses that date's temperature data.


COMPONENT 3: ANALYZE BUTTON
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
A blue button that says "Analyze Heat Risk" (changes to "Analyzing..." when working).

PURPOSE:
Triggers the AI analysis using NASA satellite data.

HOW IT WORKS:
Click the button → Sends city and date to backend → Backend fetches NASA data → Results appear below


COMPONENT 4: TEMPERATURE CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Large number like "35.2°C" with label "Land Surface Temp"

PURPOSE:
Shows the actual ground temperature from NASA satellites.

HOW IT WORKS:
NASA POWER API provides temperature readings from satellites measuring Earth's surface. This is the base temperature before considering urban effects.

EXAMPLE:
Delhi in summer might show 42°C, while London in winter shows 8°C.


COMPONENT 5: HEAT INDEX CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Temperature with Urban Heat Island effect added, like "37.5°C" labeled "Feels Like (with UHI)"

PURPOSE:
Shows how much hotter it actually feels in the city due to urban development.

HOW IT WORKS:
Takes base temperature and adds extra heat from:
- Dense population (more people = more heat)
- Lack of trees (trees provide cooling)
- Buildings and concrete (absorb and radiate heat)

EXAMPLE:
Base temp: 35°C
Urban heat island effect: +2.5°C
Feels like: 37.5°C

INTERPRETATION:
Cities are always hotter than surrounding rural areas. This "urban heat island" effect can add 2-6°C to the temperature.


COMPONENT 6: RISK INDEX CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
A score from 0-10, like "7/10" with color coding (green=safe, red=dangerous)

PURPOSE:
Single number that tells you how dangerous the heat is.

HOW IT WORKS:
Combines three factors:
1. Temperature (50% weight) - Higher temp = higher risk
2. Population density (30% weight) - More people = more vulnerable
3. Tree coverage (20% weight) - More trees = lower risk

EXAMPLE:
Delhi summer: 42°C temp + high density + low trees = 7.2/10 (High Risk)
London winter: 8°C temp + medium density + good trees = 2.1/10 (Low Risk)

SCALE:
0-3: Low Risk (Green) - Safe, no special precautions
3-5: Moderate Risk (Yellow) - Stay hydrated
5-7: High Risk (Orange) - Limit outdoor activity
7-10: Critical Risk (Red) - Dangerous, stay indoors


COMPONENT 7: AFFECTED POPULATION CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Number like "675K" labeled "Vulnerable Groups"

PURPOSE:
Shows how many people are at risk from the heat.

HOW IT WORKS:
Estimates vulnerable population based on:
- Total city population
- Risk level
- Demographics (elderly, children, outdoor workers)

EXAMPLE:
City population: 1.5 million
Risk level: Critical (7+)
Vulnerable percentage: 45%
Affected: 675,000 people

WHO'S VULNERABLE:
- Elderly people (65+)
- Young children (under 5)
- Outdoor workers
- Low-income communities without AC
- People with heart/lung conditions


COMPONENT 8: TEMPERATURE TRENDS CHART
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Line graph showing temperature changes over the past 12 months.

PURPOSE:
Visualizes seasonal patterns and temperature trends.

HOW IT WORKS:
Plots monthly average temperatures to show:
- Hottest months (summer peak)
- Coolest months (winter low)
- Seasonal transitions

EXAMPLE:
Delhi pattern:
- Jan-Feb: Cool (18-22°C)
- Mar-May: Rising heat (28-42°C)
- Jun-Aug: Monsoon cooling (30-35°C)
- Sep-Dec: Gradual cooling (32-18°C)


COMPONENT 9: 3D SATELLITE MAP
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Interactive 3D map of the selected city with satellite imagery.

PURPOSE:
Lets you explore the city visually and see urban layout.

HOW IT WORKS:
Google Maps displays the city in 3D with:
- Satellite imagery from space
- 3D building models
- Ability to rotate and tilt view
- Street View option (drag orange person icon)

CONTROLS:
- Drag to move around
- Scroll to zoom in/out
- Ctrl+Drag to rotate
- Shift+Drag to tilt for 3D view


COMPONENT 10: COOLING POTENTIAL CALCULATOR
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Text like "Potential Temperature Reduction: -3.5°C" and "Timeframe: 3-5 years"

PURPOSE:
Shows how much cooler the city could become by adding more trees.

HOW IT WORKS:
Calculates based on research showing:
- Every 10% increase in tree coverage = 1-2°C cooling
- Compares current trees to WHO target (30%)
- Estimates time needed to plant trees

EXAMPLE:
Current tree coverage: 15%
WHO target: 30%
Gap: 15% more trees needed
Cooling effect: 15% ÷ 10% × 1.5°C = 2.25°C cooler
Time: Need to plant 15,000 trees at 10,000/year = 2-3 years

INTERPRETATION:
This shows the city CAN reduce heat significantly through green infrastructure. It's not permanent - we can fix it!


COMPONENT 11: RECOMMENDATIONS LIST
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Numbered list of specific actions like:
1. "Establish emergency cooling centers in public buildings"
2. "Issue heat health warnings to vulnerable populations"
3. "Plant 50,000 trees over next 3 years"

PURPOSE:
Provides actionable steps city planners can take immediately.

HOW IT WORKS:
AI generates recommendations based on:
- Risk level (critical = urgent actions)
- Tree coverage gap
- Population vulnerability
- WHO best practices

EXAMPLE FOR CRITICAL RISK:
- Immediate: Open cooling centers
- Short-term: Heat warnings, water stations
- Long-term: Plant trees, cool roofs, green corridors

EXAMPLE FOR LOW RISK:
- Maintain current green spaces
- Continue monitoring
- Gradual improvements


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PAGE 3: GREEN SPACE ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPONENT 1: THREE PERSPECTIVES CARDS
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Three cards explaining the analysis framework:
1. AVAILABILITY - How much green space exists
2. ACCESSIBILITY - How close are people to parks
3. VISIBILITY - How visible is the greenery

PURPOSE:
Explains that we analyze green space from three different angles, not just one number.

HOW IT WORKS:
This is based on scientific research (GreenEx_Py methodology) that says you need to measure:
- Quantity (how much)
- Proximity (how close)
- Visibility (can you see it)


COMPONENT 2: COVERAGE PERCENTAGE CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Large percentage like "18.5%" labeled "Green Space Coverage"

PURPOSE:
Shows what percentage of the city is covered by vegetation.

HOW IT WORKS:
NASA satellites measure vegetation using NDVI (plant health indicator). The system counts how many pixels show vegetation vs. buildings/roads.

EXAMPLE:
City area: 100 km²
Vegetated area: 18.5 km²
Coverage: 18.5%

INTERPRETATION:
- Below 15%: Critical (very little green space)
- 15-25%: Below target (needs improvement)
- 25-30%: Approaching target
- Above 30%: Meets WHO standard ✓

WHO RECOMMENDS: 30% minimum coverage for healthy cities


COMPONENT 3: NDVI SCORE CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Number like "0.35" with label "Moderate Vegetation"

PURPOSE:
Shows vegetation health and density from satellite data.

HOW IT WORKS:
NDVI = Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
- Satellites measure how plants reflect light
- Healthy plants reflect infrared strongly
- Score ranges from -1 to 1

SCALE:
- Below 0: Water, snow, bare ground
- 0-0.2: Urban areas, sparse vegetation
- 0.2-0.4: Grasslands, shrubs (MODERATE)
- 0.4-0.6: Good vegetation
- 0.6-1.0: Dense forests (EXCELLENT)

EXAMPLE:
Score 0.35 = Moderate vegetation
This means the city has some green space but it's not very dense. Think scattered trees and small parks, not forests.


COMPONENT 4: ACCESSIBILITY SCORE
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Rating like "Good" or "Poor" with distance "450m to nearest park"

PURPOSE:
Tells you how far people have to walk to reach green space.

HOW IT WORKS:
Measures walking distance from any point in the city to the closest park.

WHO STANDARD: Parks should be within 300 meters (5-minute walk)

SCALE:
- Under 300m: Excellent ✓
- 300-500m: Good
- 500-800m: Moderate
- Over 800m: Poor ✗

EXAMPLE:
Distance: 450m
Rating: Good (close to target)
Walking time: ~6 minutes

INTERPRETATION:
Even if a city has lots of parks (good coverage), if they're far apart, accessibility is poor. Both matter!


COMPONENT 5: GAP ANALYSIS VISUAL BAR
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Progress bar with:
- Green section showing current coverage (18.5%)
- Gray section showing gap to target (11.5%)
- Labels: "Current" and "Target: 30%"

PURPOSE:
Visual representation of how far the city is from WHO standard.

HOW IT WORKS:
Simple subtraction:
Current: 18.5%
Target: 30%
Gap: 30 - 18.5 = 11.5% more green space needed

INTERPRETATION:
The green bar shows what you have.
The gray area shows what you still need.
Longer gray area = more work needed.

EXAMPLE:
If bar is 62% filled (18.5/30), you're about 2/3 of the way there.


COMPONENT 6: PER CAPITA GREEN SPACE
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Three numbers:
- "Green Space Per Capita: 11.1 m²/person"
- "WHO Recommendation: 9 m²/person"
- "Status: Meets Standard ✓"

PURPOSE:
Shows if there's enough green space per person, not just total amount.

HOW IT WORKS:
Takes total green area and divides by population.

EXAMPLE:
Total green area: 16.6 km² = 16,600,000 m²
Population: 1,500,000 people
Per capita: 16,600,000 ÷ 1,500,000 = 11.1 m² per person

INTERPRETATION:
WHO says each person needs at least 9 m² of green space (about the size of a small bedroom).
11.1 m² exceeds this, so ✓ GOOD!

INTERESTING NOTE:
A city can have:
- Low coverage % (18.5%) but
- High per capita (11.1 m²)

Both are true! Coverage = % of land, Per capita = space per person.


COMPONENT 7: PARKS COUNT & DISTRIBUTION
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Statistics like:
- "Total Parks: 45"
- "Average Size: 0.37 km²"
- "Street Trees: 28,000"

PURPOSE:
Gives detailed breakdown of green infrastructure.

HOW IT WORKS:
Counts parks from map data and calculates averages.

EXAMPLE:
45 parks
Total area: 16.6 km²
Average: 16.6 ÷ 45 = 0.37 km² per park
(That's about 37 hectares or 91 acres - medium-sized park)

Street trees: Estimated from road network length

INTERPRETATION:
More parks = better distribution
Larger average size = substantial parks, not just tiny patches
More street trees = better urban cooling and air quality


COMPONENT 8: VISIBILITY INDEX
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Percentage like "32%" with progress bar

PURPOSE:
Measures how much greenery you can actually see while walking around.

HOW IT WORKS:
Simulates walking through the city and checks if you can see green space within 100 meters at each point.

EXAMPLE:
Sample 10,000 points along streets
At 3,200 points, you can see greenery
Visibility: 3,200 ÷ 10,000 = 32%

INTERPRETATION:
- Below 20%: Poor - feels like concrete jungle
- 20-40%: Moderate - some green visible
- 40-60%: Good - regularly see greenery
- Above 60%: Excellent - green city feel

32% = Moderate visibility
You'll see some trees and parks while walking, but not everywhere.


COMPONENT 9: RECOMMENDATIONS LIST
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Specific actions like:
1. "Increase green space by 11.5%"
2. "Add 5-8 new parks (currently 45)"
3. "Street tree planting program: 10,000 trees"
4. "Develop linear parks along waterways"

PURPOSE:
Tells city planners exactly what to do to reach WHO standards.

HOW IT WORKS:
Based on gap analysis:
- Need 11.5% more coverage
- Estimate 2% coverage per new park
- Need 5-6 new parks
- Plus street trees for quick wins

INTERPRETATION:
These aren't vague suggestions - they're specific, measurable actions with clear targets.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PAGE 4: HEALTHCARE ACCESS ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPONENT 1: FACILITIES COUNT CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Numbers like:
- "98 Total Facilities"
- "28 Primary Care Centers"
- "5 Hospitals"
- "12 Emergency Centers"

PURPOSE:
Shows how many healthcare facilities exist in the city.

HOW IT WORKS:
Counts facilities from map databases and categorizes them by type.

INTERPRETATION:
More facilities = better, but location matters more than count!
A city could have 100 facilities all in one neighborhood - that's not helpful.


COMPONENT 2: 15-MINUTE ACCESS CARD
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Large percentage like "65%" labeled "Population with 15-min Access"

PURPOSE:
Shows what percentage of people can reach a healthcare facility within 15 minutes by car.

HOW IT WORKS:
For each facility, draws a 15-minute drive-time zone around it. Counts how many people live within these zones.

EXAMPLE:
Total population: 1,500,000
People within 15-min: 975,000
Access: 975,000 ÷ 1,500,000 = 65%

INTERPRETATION:
- Below 60%: Critical ✗ (Red)
- 60-75%: Needs Improvement (Orange)
- 75-85%: Good (Yellow)
- Above 85%: Excellent ✓ (Green)

65% = Needs Improvement
This means 35% of people (525,000) live too far from healthcare!


COMPONENT 3: HOSPITAL BEDS METRIC
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Three numbers:
- "Current: 12.67 per 1,000 people"
- "WHO Target: 3 per 1,000"
- "Gap: 0 beds needed"

PURPOSE:
Compares hospital bed availability to WHO minimum standard.

HOW IT WORKS:
Total beds: 19,000
Population: 1,500,000
Beds per 1,000: (19,000 ÷ 1,500,000) × 1,000 = 12.67

WHO requires: 3 beds per 1,000 = 4,500 total beds
City has: 19,000 beds
Gap: 4,500 - 19,000 = -14,500 (SURPLUS!)
Gap shown: 0 (no additional beds needed)

INTERPRETATION:
Gap = 0 means GOOD NEWS! ✓
The city has 4x more beds than WHO minimum.
This is excellent - plenty of capacity for patients.


COMPONENT 4: DOCTORS METRIC
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
- "Current: 5.42 per 1,000 people"
- "WHO Target: 1 per 1,000"
- "Gap: 0 doctors needed"

PURPOSE:
Compares doctor availability to WHO standard.

HOW IT WORKS:
Total doctors: 8,130
Population: 1,500,000
Doctors per 1,000: (8,130 ÷ 1,500,000) × 1,000 = 5.42

WHO requires: 1 per 1,000 = 1,500 doctors
City has: 8,130 doctors
Gap: 0 (surplus of 6,630 doctors!)

INTERPRETATION:
Gap = 0 means EXCELLENT! ✓
City has 5x more doctors than WHO minimum.
Quality of care is very good.


COMPONENT 5: FACILITIES PER 100K METRIC
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
- "Current: 6.5 per 100,000 people"
- "WHO Target: 10 per 100,000"
- "Gap: ~52 facilities needed"

PURPOSE:
Measures facility density - are there enough locations?

HOW IT WORKS:
Total facilities: 98
Population: 1,500,000
Per 100K: (98 ÷ 1,500,000) × 100,000 = 6.53

WHO requires: 10 per 100K = 150 total facilities
City has: 98 facilities
Gap: 150 - 98 = 52 facilities needed ✗

INTERPRETATION:
Gap = 52 means PROBLEM! ✗
Even though beds and doctors are plentiful, there aren't enough facility LOCATIONS.

KEY INSIGHT:
- Beds: Surplus ✓
- Doctors: Surplus ✓
- Facilities: Deficit ✗

This means resources are concentrated in too few locations. People have to travel far even though quality is good.

SOLUTION: Build more facilities in underserved areas, not add more beds to existing ones.


COMPONENT 6: UNDERSERVED AREAS MAP
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Map with red zones highlighted showing areas beyond 15-minute access.

PURPOSE:
Visually identifies neighborhoods that lack healthcare access.

HOW IT WORKS:
Highlights areas where:
- No facility within 15-minute drive
- High population density
- Vulnerable demographics

EXAMPLE:
"North District" - 45,000 people, 25 min to nearest facility
"East Suburbs" - 38,000 people, 20 min to nearest facility

INTERPRETATION:
These red zones are priority areas for new facilities.


COMPONENT 7: RECOMMENDED FACILITY LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
Map markers with text like:
"Priority 1: North District (serves 45K people)"
"Priority 2: East Suburbs (serves 38K people)"

PURPOSE:
Shows optimal locations for new healthcare facilities.

HOW IT WORKS:
Algorithm finds locations that:
- Serve the most underserved people
- Minimize overlap with existing facilities
- Maximize population coverage

EXAMPLE:
Building facility in North District would:
- Give 45,000 people access
- Reduce average drive time from 25 to 8 minutes
- Cost-effective: serves large population

INTERPRETATION:
These aren't random suggestions - they're optimized to help the most people with fewest new facilities.


COMPONENT 8: WAIT TIME METRIC
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
"Average Wait Time: 45 minutes" with target "< 30 minutes"

PURPOSE:
Shows how long patients wait to see a doctor.

HOW IT WORKS:
Estimates based on:
- Facility capacity (beds × patients per day)
- Patient demand (% of population seeking care daily)
- Utilization rate (how full facilities are)

EXAMPLE:
High utilization (busy facilities) = longer waits
Low utilization (empty facilities) = shorter waits

45 minutes = Moderate wait (could be better)

INTERPRETATION:
Even with good bed/doctor ratios, if facilities are far apart, people cluster at accessible ones, causing waits.


COMPONENT 9: QUALITY SCORE
-----------------------------------
WHAT IT SHOWS:
"Quality Score: 72/100" with breakdown

PURPOSE:
Single number summarizing overall healthcare system quality.

HOW IT WORKS:
Combines multiple factors:
- Access percentage (30% weight)
- Facility density (20% weight)
- Beds per capita (20% weight)
- Doctors per capita (15% weight)
- Wait times (15% weight)

EXAMPLE:
Access: 65/100
Facilities: 65/100
Beds: 100/100 (capped at 100)
Doctors: 100/100 (capped at 100)
Wait: 40/100

Weighted average: 72/100

INTERPRETATION:
- 0-40: Poor
- 40-60: Fair
- 60-80: Good (this city)
- 80-100: Excellent

72 = Good but room for improvement
Main issue: Geographic access, not resource quality
